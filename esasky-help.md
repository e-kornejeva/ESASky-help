# EDDIE Cut-out Image Service
#### URL: https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/esdc/cutout-service

This service is intended for the generation of high resolution astronomical images, given a field-of-view (FoV), a HiPS map and a specific projection. The output image format is configurable, as well as the zoom level (HealPix nOrder) and the size of the output images.

#### IMG: https://www.cosmos.esa.int/documents/401090/442498/eddie1.png/9abbc48b-5d16-13fb-b45f-f0aa81ddd7b9?t=1527068696671

To extract your image, start by defining the desired area in the Aladin widget: You have to enter the name or coordinates of your object and adjust the zoom level. Then click on “Get Aladin FoV” to retrieve the right ascension (RA), declination (Dec), FoV size and aspect ratio of the image. Next, choose a sky map from the HiPS menu. The size of the output image can also be customised via the “Image Size” text box. Click on “Refresh image” and then on “Open image in new tab” to display the real cut-out generated image.

#### IMG: https://www.cosmos.esa.int/documents/401090/442498/eddie2.png/9a17f236-65a4-b7f9-3609-073404055778?t=1527068820986

Additional support for selecting the cut-out area or “polygon” is available through the “Input Area” selector.

If you want to use the generated image in other web pages, please use the "Save image" feature of your browser instead of the service URL, to avoid generating the image each time that a user accesses your web page.

You can access the service [here](http://sky.esa.int/hipsCutout/index.html).

Go to [this page](http://sky.esa.int/hipsCutout/help.html) to read the full documentation, and to [](http://sky.esa.int/hipsCutout/adsHelp.html)[this page](http://sky.esa.int/hipsCutout/adsHelp.html) for the ADS thumbnails documentation.

## INTEGRAL

#### URL: https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/esdc/esasky-observations#INTEGRAL

INTEGRAL/IBIS observations consist on a large number of individual exposures (science windows) around a target position.  For this reason and because of the large size of the IBIS field-of-view, it is unpractical to display the geometric footprints of all these science windows. Instead, _ESASky_ only displays the central pointing position of each IBIS observation, each of which is linked to the full list of science windows associated with it.

The data are downloaded from the [INTEGRAL science archive](http://www.isdc.unige.ch/integral/archive) at the [INTEGRAL Science Data Centre](http://www.isdc.unige.ch/integral/) (ISDC) in Geneva (Switzerland). The current implementation links each observation to its corresponding set of science windows in the archive, which can therefore be downloaded as a group. It is however not possible to select more than one observation, because grouping several of them could result in a set of science windows that is too large to be handled correctly at this time.

## xmm-newton

#### URL: https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/esdc/esasky-observations#XMM-Newton-OBS

The observations include public high-level Processing Pipeline System (PPS) products present in the XMM-Newton Science Archive ([XSA](http://nxsa.esac.esa.int/nxsa-web/#home)). Detailed information on XMM-Newton products can be found in the [XMM-Newton Science Archive Data Products Guide.](http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/xmm-newton/guide-to-xmm-products)

A brief description of the products provided by _ESASky_ is given below. For more information about the mission please visit the [XMM-Newton Science Operations Centre](http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/xmm-newton/) web pages.

### EPIC Cameras (IMAGING)

The data included are the combined high-level image products from the three cameras (EPIC PN, EPIC MOS1, and EPIC MOS2) in the 0.2-12 keV energy band, updated weekly. For more information see the [EPIC camera technical details page](http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/xmm-newton/technical-details-epic/).

The selection criteria are based on the existence of a public EPIC high-level combined image. The mosaic sub-pointing products are excluded but the whole combined mosaic observations are included.

Observation footprints were obtained from the Sensitivity Map (OSNSMP) products associated to EPIC images. The sensitivity map gives the minimum source flux detectable by the point source detection task of the pipeline software when analysing EPIC images.

*   Data type: EPIC Observation Image (OIMAGE).

*   Energy Range: 0.2-12 keV.

*   Date of observations: From February 2000, updated regularly

*   Postcard preview filenames: P\[obsid\]EPX000OIMAGE8000.png

*   Science products filenames: P\[obsid\]EPX000OIMAGE8000.fits

IMPORTANT NOTE: There are 62 observations used as input for the [XMM-Newton Epic HiPS](http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/esdc/esasky-skies#XMM) map that are not linked yet in the application. This is due to the fact that these PPS products, the EPIC THREE COLOUR IMAGES, were generated  for the sky map by running the pps task etruecolor (xcolorcod-1.28) by XMM-Newton SOC (P.Rodriguez). These observations do not have a PPS EPIC combined Image although they do have one or several EPIC cameras in Image mode.

### OPTICAL MONITOR (OM - IMAGING)

The [Optical Monitor](http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/xmm-newton/technical-details-om) (OM) data in ESASky are public observations with at least one OM high-level image pipeline product, where individual OM sky images per filter are combined and North-aligned. Included in ESASky are the following OM Sky Image file types: RSIMAG Default-mode (RSIMAG), Full-frame low resolution (LSIMAG), Full-frame high resolution (HSIMAG), and User Defined (USIMAG).

*   Data type(s): OM Sky Combined Images (RSIMAG, LSIMAG, HSIMAG, USIMAG).

*   Science product filenames:   P\[obsid\]OMX000OIMAGE8000.fits

### Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS - spectroscopy)

Each of the two Reflection Grating Spectrometers (RGS) onboard XMM-Newton consists of an array of reflection gratings which diffracts the X-rays to an array of dedicated charge coupled devices (CCD) detectors, using an aperture of 5’ over the whole detector array (30’ diameter). 

The RGS instruments achieve high resolving power (150 to 800) over a range from 5 to 35 Å \[0.33 to 2.5 keV\] (in the first spectral order). The effective area peaks around 15 Å \[0.83 keV\] (first order) at about 150 cm2 for the two spectrometers. 

_ESASky_ provides all spectra extracted within each aperture.

*   Data type: RGS Fluxed Spectrum

*   Energy Range: 0.2-12 keV

*   Date of observations: From February 2000, updated regularly

## IUE (SPECTROSCOPY)

#### URL: https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/esdc/esasky-observations#IUE

The International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) was a joint project between ESA, NASA and the UK PPARC. The mission operated between  1978 and 1996 with three Echelle spectrographs: SWP, LWP and LWR (a fourth instrument, SWR, was never operational). The table below summarises the characteristics of all three instruments. 


|Instrument|Spectral coverage|Sensitivity                |
|----------|-----------------|---------------------------|
|SWP       |1150-1980 Å      | 2 10-15 erg sec-1 cm-2 Å-1|
|LWP       |1850-3350 Å      |1 10-15 erg sec-1 cm-2 Å-1 |
|LWR       |1850-3350 Å      |2 10-15 erg sec-1 cm-2 Å-1 |


In all cases, two apertures were available: a small circular aperture of 3’’ radius, and a large 10’’ x 20’’ rectangular aperture. In low-resolution mode, the resolution is ~ 0.6 nm, corresponding to resolving powers of R ~ 250 at 150 nm and R ~ 450 at 270 nm. In high-resolution mode, the resolution is ~ 0.02 nm, corresponding to resolving powers of R ~ 7500 at 150 nm and R ~ 13500 at 270 nm, respectively.

_ESASky_ provides fully calibrated spectra from all three spectrographs, which are directly retrieved from the [IU Newly Extracted Spectra (INES) archive](http://sdc.cab.inta-csic.es/ines/index2.html), hosted at the [Centro de Astrobiología (CAB)](http://cab.inta-csic.es/en/) near Madrid (Spain).

### THe HST Collection

The HST collection is the standard HST archive content and contains the following:

*   All public (non-proprietary) HST data.
*   The standard HST archive products from the active instruments (ACS, COS, STIS, WFC3). These products are kept current by the HST Cache system described [here](http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/hst/archive-contents).
*   Data from legacy instruments (FOC, FOS, HRS, NICMOS, WFPC, WFPC2). These data have gone through a final calibration run and are not foreseen to change anymore.

Detailed information on the data produced by each instrument aboard the Hubble Space Telescope can be found in the official HST Instrument Handbooks, on the main [HST Documentation page](https://www.stsci.edu/hst/documentation).

### THE HLA COLLECTION

*   Release: Data Release 10.0 (8th January 2018)
    

The HLA is a joint project of the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI), the Space Telescope European Coordinating Facility (ST-ECF), and the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre (CADC). The HLA collection in the eHST contains enhanced image products for WFPC2 (produced by the CADC), ACS, NICMOS and WFC3 (produced by the STScI). Spectroscopy will be added very soon.

### THe HLSP Collection

The High Level Science Products (HLSP) are community contributed, fully processed (reduced, co-added, cosmic-ray cleaned etc.) images and spectra that are ready for scientific analysis. Currently, ESASky only contains the HLSPs from GOODS North + South.

More information on the HLSPs can be found [here](https://archive.stsci.edu/hlsp/).

## CHEOPS

#### URL https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/esdc/esasky-observations#CHEOPS

CHEOPS is an ESA mission developed in partnership with Switzerland, with a dedicated consortium led by the University of Bern, and with important contributions from Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the UK. The satellite has a single payload comprising an ultra-high precision photometer covering the 330 - 1100 nm wavelength range in a single photometric band. Observations are made as part of the Guaranteed Time Observing Programme that is formulated by the CHEOPS Science Team and the Guest Observers Programme through which the Community at large can apply for CHEOPS time. The subset of CHEOPS data available through ESASky includes an example of a light  curve (the highest level data product produced by the automated data reduction pipeline) and the data reduction pipeline report for each public science observation.  These have been extracted from the [CHEOPS Mission Archive](https://cheops.unige.ch/archive_browser/) which can be queried to retrieve selected metadata for all scientific observations made by CHEOPS (public and proprietary), as well as the full set of data products for all public data. CHEOPS light curves retain the imprint of the c. 98 minute satellite orbit, which introduces periodic systematics which in turn can be removed by de-trending. 

Metadata and data products displayed in ESASky include: 

*   Data type: CHEOPS light curve (extracted using the “optimal aperture”), Data reduction pipeline report .

*   Spectral Range: 330 - 1100 nm (visible - near-infrared).

*   Date of observations: From December 2019, updated regularly.

## JWST

#### URL: https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/esdc/esasky-observations#JWST

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is the largest optical or infrared observatory ever launched to space. Developed in a collaboration between NASA, ESA, and CSA, Webb observes the Universe in infrared light from its orbit at the Lagrangian point L2, 1.5 million km away from Earth.

Following launch, and after an initial commissioning phase of 6 months, the observatory has entered its regular science operations phase, during which approved observation programs will be performed. Scientific data is collected from a set of observer-created programs placed on a timeline of activities sent up to the spacecraft up to twice a day during operations. The products provided in ESASky are level 3 science products, not including comissioning data (use the [ESASky Search interface of the eJWST archive](https://jwst.esac.esa.int/archive/#esasky) to also view comissioning data).

A brief description of the products provided in _ESASky_ is given below. For more information about the mission please visit the [JWST ESA web pages](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/jwst) and the [STScI JWST web pages](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst).

### MIRI (IMAGING and Spectroscopy)

The Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) provides JWST observers with coverage of mid-infrared wavelengths from 4.9 to 28.8 μm. Imaging can be obtained with 9 broad-band filters covering the wavelength ranges from 5.6μm to 25.5 μm. Spectroscopy can be obtained with a low spectral resolving power mode from 5-12 μm that includes both slitted and slitless options, or with a medium spectral resolving power integral field unit from 4.9 μm-28.8 μm. MIRI also contains one Lyot and three 4-quadrant phase mask coronagraphs that are optimized to the mid-infrared spectral region.

For more information about MIRI please see [here](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/instrumentation/instruments#section-8501a99f-ddf2-450d-aebe-32956f6339a7) and for detailed instrument information, please consult the [MIRI JWST User Documentation](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/x/sQTXBQ) (JDox).

### NIRCam (Imaging, Spectroscopy AND Time-Series)

The Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) is JWST’s primary imager in the wavelength range from 0.6 to 5 μm. It consists of two, nearly identical, fully redundant modules, which point to adjacent fields of view on the sky and can be used simultaneously. Each module uses a dichroic to also observe simultaneously in both the short wavelength channel (0.6–2.3 μm) and long wavelength channel (2.4–5.0 μm).  

In addition to imaging with a wide range of narrow, medium, and broad filters, NIRCam also offers wide field slitless (grism) spectroscopy and coronagraphic imaging modes, as well as time-series and grism time-series observing modes for high accuracy photometric monitoring and spectrophotometric monitoring, respectively. NIRCam also obtains wavefront sensing measurements critical for periodic alignment and phasing of the segments of JWST's primary mirror.

For more information about NIRCam please see [here](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/instrumentation/instruments#section-dad70e46-0c50-44a5-90e9-93c3a8ecee3e) and for detailed instrument information, please consult the [NIRCam JWST User Documentation](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/x/ZwbXBQ) (JDox).

### NIRISS (Imaging, Spectroscopy AND Interferometry)

The JWST Near-Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS) provides unique observational capabilities between 0.6 and 5 μm that complement those available with NIRCam and NIRSpec. Its efficient, all-reflective design enables low-resolution, wide-field grism spectroscopy; medium-resolution grism spectroscopy optimized for applications requiring extreme spectrophotometric stability; aperture masking interferometry; and parallel imaging through filters matched to those available with NIRCam. 

For more information about NIRISS please see [here](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/instrumentation/instruments#section-3878b739-5da4-49bb-93c1-6730bc8d19b9) and for detailed instrument information, please consult the [NIRISS JWST User Documentation](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/x/AgrXBQ) (JDox).

### NIRSpec (Time-Series AND Spectroscopy: fixed slits, IFU & MOS)

JWST's Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) is a versatile spectroscopic instrument that operates in the 0.6 to 5.3 μm wavelength range. NIRSpec offers high throughput single object spectroscopy through fixed slits, spatially-resolved integral field unit spectroscopy, and a powerful multi-object spectroscopic mode using a micro-shutter assembly. NIRSpec also has a bright object time-series mode through a wide aperture that provides high throughput/high accuracy spectrophotometric monitoring capabilities to the astronomical community.

For more information about NIRSpec please see [here](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/instrumentation/instruments#section-8bc155d1-1325-4c34-b2c0-c1bb6524cdbd) and for detailed instrument information, please consult the [NIRSpec JWST User Documentation](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/x/3QvXBQ) (JDox).

## ISO

#### URL: https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/esdc/esasky-observations#ISO-OBS

The Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) was the world's first true orbiting infrared observatory launched in November 1995. It carried four scientific instruments: two spectrometers (SWS and LWS), an imaging photo-polarimeter (ISOPHOT) and a camera (ISOCAM). The only ISO imaging data provided through the _ESASky_ interface are those from ISOCAM. Spectroscopic data from all four instruments are provided.

ISO spectroscopic observations were carried out with a variety of apertures and in raster mode, that is, performed by shifting the instrument aperture in the sky following a user-defined pattern. Since the information on the exact paintings within a raster was not easily retrievable, the _ESASky_ footprints for these observations represent the overall raster shape, approximated by a rectangle. 

What follows is a brief description of the different data provided by _ESASky_. For more information on ISO observational data please visit the [ISO Archive](http://iso.esac.esa.int/ida/).

### isocam (imaging and spectrophotometry) 

ISOCAM mapped selected areas in the sky in the spectral region from 2.5 to 18 micron with different spatial and spectral resolutions. 

### imaging

ISOCAM provided imaging capabilities across a field of view of up to 3’ diameter. It consisted of two 32x32 pixels infrared detector arrays (used one at a time). The short wavelength channel operated between 2.5 and 5.2 microns, and the long wavelength channel, between 4 and 18 microns. Different configurations yielded spatial resolutions of 1.5, 3, 6 and 12’’ per pixel, translating into fields of view of 48’’x48’’, 96’’x96’’, 192’’x192’’ and 384’’x384’’, respectively. Broad and narrow-band filters were available.

### lws (spectroscopy)

The Long Wavelength Spectrometer (LWS) covered the spectral range between 43 and 197 micron at medium and high resolution. The spectral circular aperture had a diameter of 84’’; raster observations were also possible.

Grating mode, in which only the grating was used, provided moderate spectral resolving power of about 0.29 micron in the short-wavelength channels (SW1-SW5) and 0.6 micron in the long-wavelength channels (LW1-LW3, LW5) corresponding to a resolving power of between 100 and 300 depending on the wavelengths being investigated. The Fabry-Pérot mode, in which one of the two Fabry-Pérots was used in combination with the grating, provided high spectral resolving power between  8,000 and 10,000.

*   Data type(s): L01, L02, L03, L04 (Scientifically validated)

### sws (spectroscopy)

The Short Wavelength Spectrometer (SWS) provided medium and high spectral resolution in the wavelength region 2.38-45.2 micron. Its two largely independent grating spectrometers had a spectral resolution of R~1000-2000, corresponding to a velocity resolution of approximately 150-300 km/s. By inserting Fabry-Pérot (FP) filters, one for the range 15-26 micron (with capability down to 11.4 micron at reduced resolution) and the other for the region 26-35 micron (with capability to 44.5 micron at reduced sensitivity), the resolution could be increased to R~30,000, or approximately 10 km/s.

*   Pipeline Version: AAC v10.3​

### isophot (spectrophotometry)

ISOPHOT (PHT) was the imaging photo-polarimeter on board ISO. Its four principal modes were single detector element aperture photometry (3 - 120 microns), array imaging (40 - 240 microns), polarimetry (25, 170 microns) and spectrophotometry (2.5 - 12 microns). Only the spectrophotometric data are provided through _ESASky_.

The spectrophotometric mode was dedicated to obtaining low resolution spectra of broad spectral features such as dust and poliaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) features. It used an aperture of 24’’x24’’; raster observations were also possible.

### Advanced CCD Imaging Spectometer (ACIS - imaging and spectroscopy)

The Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) is an X-ray imager and moderate resolution spectrometer that operates in the energy range of 0.2 - 10 keV. ACIS has two arrays of CCDs, one (ACIS-I) optimised for imaging wide fields (16x16 arc minutes) the other (ACIS-S) optimised as a readout for the High Energy Transmision Grating (HETG). One chip of the ACIS-S (S3) is also used for on-axis (8x8 arc minutes) imaging and has the best energy resolution of the ACIS system. The data included in ESASky are the ACIS image and spectra. For more information see the [ACIS Instrument information page](http://cxc.harvard.edu/cal/Acis/index.html) and the [Proposer's Observatory Guide](http://cxc.harvard.edu/proposer/POG/html/chap6.html#tth_chAp6).

### High Resolution Camera (HRC - imaging and spectroscopy)

The High Resolution Camera (HRC) has two micro-channel plate imaging detectors, the HRC-I optimised for imaging and the HRC-S for spectroscopy. The HRC-I has the largest field of view aboard Chandra (31x31 arc minutes) and images over the range of 0.1 - 10 keV. The data included in ESASky are the HRC images and spectra. For more information see the [HRC Instrument information page](http://cxc.cfa.harvard.edu/cal/Hrc/index.html) and the [Proposer's Observatory Guide](http://cxc.harvard.edu/proposer/POG/html/chap7.html#tth_chAp7).

*   Pipeline Version: DS 8.x.x to 10.x.x

### Low Energy Transmission Grating (LETG - spectroscopy)

The Low Energy Transmission Grating (LETG) provides the highest spectral resolving power (E/ΔE > 1000) on Chandra at low energies (0.07-0.15 keV, 80-175 Å) and moderate resolving power (E/ΔE ~ 20xλ) at higher energies (3-50 Å, 0.25-4.13 keV). The LETG comprises a grating assembly which intercepts and disperses flux from the mirrors. The HRC or ACIS can be used to read out the dispersed spectra. The LETG/HRC-S combination is used extensively for high resolution spectroscopy of bright, soft sources such as stellar coronae, white dwarf atmospheres and cataclysmic variables. For more information see the [LETG Instrument information page](http://cxc.harvard.edu/cal/letg/index.html) and the [Proposer's Observatory Guide](http://cxc.harvard.edu/proposer/POG/html/chap7.html#tth_chAp7).

*   Pipeline Version: DS 8.x.x to 10.x.x

### High Energy Transmission Grating (HETG - spectroscopy)

The High Energy Transmission Grating (HETG) is used for high resolution spectroscopy of bright sources in the range 0.4-10 keV (31-1.2 Å). The HETG has been used to measure Doppler velocities of orbiting systems, even as low as 50 km/s, and plasma outflow velocities from a few hundred to 10's of thousands of km/s. Because the HETG can clearly resolve lines from O to Fe-K, detailed line diagnostics can be applied. It is most commonly used with ACIS-S. The resolving power (E/ΔE) varies from ~800 at 1.5 keV to ~200 at 6 keV. For more information see the [HETG Instrument information page](http://cxc.harvard.edu/cal/Hetg/index.html) and the [Proposer's Observatory Guide](http://cxc.harvard.edu/proposer/POG/html/chap7.html#tth_chAp7).

## eROSITA (MPE)

#### URL: https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/esdc/esasky-observations#eROSITA

eROSITA (extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array) is a wide-field X-ray telescope on-board the Russian-German "Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma" (SRG) observatory, and it was developed under the leadership of the [Max-Planck Institute for extraterrestrial Physics (MPE)](https://www.mpe.mpg.de/main) in Germany (DE). eROSITA is a sensitive X-ray telescope capable of delivering deep, sharp images over very large areas of the sky in the energy range ~0.2-8 keV. The eROSITA telescope consists of seven identical Wolter-1 mirror modules. Each module contains 54 nested mirror shells to meet the required sensitivity. A novel detector system has been developed by MPE based on of the successful XMM-Newton pn-CCD technology.

The German eROSITA Consortium (eROSITA-DE) makes public the (German-led) observations obtained during the Calibration and Performance Verification (Cal-PV) program. This public data release is called eROSITA-DE Early Data Release (EDR) and can be accessed through ESASky. The Cal-PV program of the SRG mission took place between mid-September and mid-December 2019. During this Cal-PV phase, over one hundred individual pointings and field scans were performed with eROSITA as prime instrument, and around thirty different fields were been observed. Detailed information on eROSITA and its products can be found in [the eROSITA-DE Science Portal](https://erosita.mpe.mpg.de/).

### GAIA FOCUSED PRODUCT RELEASE (Crowded Field Source catalogue)

*   Release: Focused Product Release (FPR) (2023)

*   Date of observations: From 1 January 2015 to 20 January 2020

*   Source: [ESA](http://gea.esac.esa.int/archive/)

*   Reference: [Gaia Collaboration, Weingrill, K., et al. 2023](https://www.aanda.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202347203) (arXiv) (ADS)

*   DOI: [https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202347203](https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202347203)

The Gaia Focused Product Release (FPR) Crowded Field Source catalogue consists of astrometry and photometry from engineering images taken in the Omega Centauri region. The sources are based on Service Interface Function (SIF) images of very dense regions in the sky. These sources build an add-on catalogue to the nominal Gaia catalogue. Nominal and SIF detections were not mixed to create these sources. These sources are thus obtained from SIF image detections only. Sources already present in the nominal catalogue were removed from the SIF add-on catalogue. The catalogue contains positions, parallaxes and proper motions for 526,457 new Gaia sources as derived from the SIF images (with 130 additional sources with positions only), and photometric information (mean G magnitude and flux) for these same 526,587 sources as derived from the SIF images.

​The Tycho-2 Catalogue is an astrometric reference catalogue containing positions, proper motions and two-colour photometry (BT and VT) for the 2.5 million brightest stars in the sky. The catalogue is based on observations made using the Hipparcos satellite star mapper and is constructed using the same observations that were used to create the original Tycho catalogue. Improved reduction techniques have resulted in a catalogue with significantly more entries and in improved precision. More information on the Tycho-2 catalogue can be found [here](https://www.rssd.esa.int/index.php?project=HIPPARCOS&page=tycho2) and [in Vizier](http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/Cat?I/259).

​XMMSL2 is the second catalogue of X-ray sources found in slew data taken from the European Space Agency's (ESA) XMM-Newton observatory, and has been constructed by members of the XMM SOC and the EPIC consortium on behalf of ESA. This release uses results of work which has been carried out within the framework of the EXTraS project ("Exploring the X-ray variable and Transient Sky"), funded from the EU's Seventh Framework Programme under grant agreement no.607452. 

XMMSL2 has been generated from 2,114 slews, executed between 2001-08-26 and 2014-12-31, revolutions 314 to 2,758. Not all slews made in this period have been used; slews with particularly high background throughout the slew or which gave processing problems have been rejected. A description of slew selection and initial processing is given [here](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/xmm-newton/xmmsl2-ug#DataSel). The slews have been processed separately in three energy bands to form three distinct surveys which have been subsequently combined to form one catalogue. After correcting for overlaps between slews, 84% of the sky has now been covered.

The release includes two FITS files. A full catalogue (xmmsl2\_total.fits.gz), containing 72,352 detections found with a likelihood of DET\_ML>8 and a "clean" catalogue (xmmsl2\_clean.fits.gz) where all known bad sources have been removed and where the detection limit has been raised to DET\_ML>10.5 in general and DET\_ML>15.5 for sources found in images with a higher than usual background. Efforts have been made to identify spurious detections and 3,017 have been flagged as such in the full catalogue

## Hubble Source Catalog (HSC)

*   Release: 3.1 (June 2019)

*   Date of observations: to October 2017

*   Source: [Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI)](https://archive.stsci.edu/hst/hsc/)

The Hubble Source Catalog is a combination of all the visit-based source lists in the Hubble Legacy Archive (HLA) into a single catalogue and is designed to optimize science from the Hubble Space Telescope by combining the tens of thousands of visit-based source lists in the HLA into a single master catalog.

The HSC v3 contains members of the WFPC2, ACS/WFC, WFC3/UVIS and WFC3/IR [Source Extractor](https://www.astromatic.net/software/sextractor) source lists from HLA version DR10 (data release 10). The cross-matching process involves adjusting the relative astrometry of overlapping images so as to minimize positional offsets between closely aligned sources in different images. After correction, the astrometric residuals of cross-matched sources are significantly reduced, with median errors less than 8 mas. The absolute astrometry is calibrated using Gaia DR1, Pan-STARRS, SDSS, and 2MASS as the astrometric backbone for initial corrections. In addition, the catalog includes source nondetections. The cross-matching algorithms and the properties of the initial (Beta 0.1) catalog are described in [Budavari & Lubow (2012)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...761..188B), and the Version 1 catalog is described in [Whitmore et al. (2016)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016AJ....151..134W).

Version 3 includes (see [here](https://archive.stsci.edu/hst/hsc/) for more details):

*   _There are approximately 25% more ACS source lists and almost twice as many WFC3 source lists compared with HSC v2._

*   _The source list photometric quality is significantly improved._

*   _Improved astrometric calibration is based on the Gaia DR1 catalog. Shifts up to 100 arcsec have been correctly identified. 94% of the fields have matches to an external astrometric reference catalog._

*   _The scatter in magnitudes is measured using the median absolute deviation (MAD) of the differences from the median magnitude for more robust estimates._

_ESASky_ displays the following default columns from the Hubble Source Catalog:

* Column name: Magnitude
  * Units: mag
  * Description: Median magnitude for the corresponding filter.
* Column name: Magnitude error
  * Units: mag
  * Description: Median absolute deviation around the median magnitude.

**Note:** There is a small positional offset (< 1") between the source coordinates from the HSC and their location on the HST HiPS maps. This is due to the fact that the HST HiPS were generated from HST data products, while the HSC was created from HLA data products, and there is a discrepancy between the astrometric solutions from both samples. An improved sample of HST HiPS will be produced soon.

See the [Caveats](http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/esdc/esasky-caveats#CATS) page for caveats on the HSC.

## All-Sky PLATO input catalogue (asPIC1.1)

*   Release: 1.1 (September 2021)

*   Date of observations: July 2014 to May 2016 (Gaia DR2)

The ESA PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars (PLATO) mission will search for terrestrial planets in the habitable zone of solar-type stars. Because of telemetry limitations, PLATO targets need to be pre-selected. The all-sky PLATO input catalogue will be fundamental to selecting the best PLATO fields and the most promising target stars, deriving their basic parameters, analysing the instrumental performances, and then planning and optimising follow-up observations. This catalogue also represents a valuable resource for the general definition of stellar samples optimised for the search of transiting planets. 

The first public release of the all sky PLATO Input catalogue (asPIC version 1.1) contains a total of 2,675,539 stars, among which are 2,378,177 FGK dwarfs and subgiants and 297,362 M dwarfs. It was produced using Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) astrometry and photometry and 3D maps of the local interstellar medium. It provides derived reddening of the targets and estimates of stellar fundamental parameters (Teff, radius, mass) from astrometric and photometric measurements using a developed algorithm.

### second PLANCK CATALOGue OF COMPACT SOURCES (PCCS2)

*   Release: 2.0 (2015)

*   Date of observations: from 13th August 2009 to 3rd August 2013

*   Source: [Planck Legacy Archive](http://pla.esac.esa.int/pla/#catalogues)

*   Reference: [Planck-2015-A35](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2016A&A...594A..26P/abstract)

The PCCS2 is a set of single-frequency source catalogues extracted from the Planck full-mission maps in intensity and polarization. These maps contain 48 months of data for the LFI channels, and 29 months of data for the HFI channels,  therefore the flux densities derived from these maps are an average of the source emission over these two periods of time. For the channels 30-353 GHz, the catalogues also contain polarization flux densities and polarization angles for sources with a significance in polarization >99.99%.

The catalogue at 100 Ghz and above has been divided into two subcatalogues: the PCCS2, including all reliable detections (>80%), and PCCS2E, including sources located in sky regions where it was not possible to estimate their reliability.

The Planck SZ catalogue is a nearly all-sky list of SZ detections obtained from the Planck data, derived from the HFI frequency channel maps after masking and filling the bright point sources (SNR>10) from the PCCS catalogues in those channels. It contains 1653 detection, of which 1203 are confirmed clusters with identified counterparts in external datasets.

The catalogue was constructed using three detection pipelines: two implementations of the matched multi-filter algorithm (MMF1 and MMF2) and a Bayesian algorithm called PowellSnakes (PwS). A union catalogue was constructed from the detections of all three pipelines. To avoid spurious detections due to foreground sources, a mask to remove Galactic dust, nearby galaxies and point sources was applied after the merging, leaving 83.7% of the sky.

The union catalogue contains the coordinates of a detection, its signal-to-noise ratio, an estimate of the total integrated Comptomization parameter Y and its uncertainty, as well as information on the generation and validation. If available, external identification of a cluster and its redshift is also provided. When more than one pipeline makes the same detection, the information is taken from the most significant detection. If the redshift is known, the SZ mass from the reference pipeline is provided.

The table below shows the columns from this catalogue displayed in ESASky:

### PLANCK CATALOGUE OF GALACTIC COLD CLUMPS (PGCC)

*   Release: 2.0 (2015)

*   Date of observations: from 13th August 2009 to 3rd August 2013

*   Source: [Planck Legacy Archive](http://pla.esac.esa.int/pla/#catalogues)

*   Reference: [Planck-2015-A37](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2016A&A...594A..28P/abstract)

The PGCC containes 13,188 Galactic sources and 54 sources located in the Magellanic Clouds, all of them identified as cold sources in Planck data (sources colder than their environment). The sources are extracted from the Planck HFI 857, 545 and 353 GHz maps and the 3 THz IRIS map. A detection requires SNR > 4 in pixels in all Planck bands and a minimum angular distance of 5 arcmin to other detections.

The derived physical properties of the PGCC sources are: temperature, column density, physical size, mass, density, and luminosity. The sources span a temperature range from 5.8 to 20 K, and a variety of physical properties corresponding to many different types of objects, from dense cold cores to large molecular clouds.

These are the columns from the PGCC catalogue displayed in ESASky:

A multi-frequency selected catalogue of high energy and very high energy gamma-ray blazars and blazar candidates (2WHSP). This catalogue contains the largest and most complete list of High Synchrotron Peaked blazars (HSPs) available to date (in 2017), which is an expansion of the 1WHSP catalog of gamma-ray source candidates off the Galactic plane. A number of multi-wavelength surveys (in the radio, infrared and X-ray bands) have been cross-matched and applied selection criteria based on the radio to IR and IR to X-ray spectral slopes.

This table comprises the 2WHSP catalog, a multi-frequency catalog of HSP. It contains 1691 sources, 288 of which are newly identified HSPs, 540 are previously known HSPs, 814 are HSP candidates, 45 are HSP blazars taken from the 2FHL catalog, and 4 from TeVCat (http://tevcat.uchicago.edu).

The AKARI IRC Point Source Catalogue Version 1.0 provides positions and fluxes of 870,973 sources (844,649 sources in 9 micron band and 194,551 sources in 18 micron band) in the Mid-Infrared wavelengths.

The IRC scanned 96 / 97 percent of the entire sky in 9 / 18 micron band twice or more during the 16 months of the cryogenic mission phase. The Point Source Catalogue is the primary catalogue from the AKARI IRC survey. The catalogue is designed to have a uniform detection limit over the entire sky, based on the uniform source detection limit per scan observation. Redundant observations are used to increase the reliability of the detection.

The AllWISE Source Catalog provides astrometry and mid-infrared photometry in four bands (3.4, 4.6, 12 and 22 microns) for 747,634,026 objects detected on the deep AllWISE Atlas Intensity Images. It improves the photometry of discrete sources in all four bands with respect to the WISE Catalog. In addition, improved source variability metrics have been computed. Astrometry has also been improved thanks to the correction of the proper motion of the reference 2MASS stars for the 11 years between the two surveys.

The table below shows the columns of the AllWISE catalogue displayed by default in ESASky (more columns can be displayed via the settings button):

### eROSITA CATALOGUES

The following catalogues from eROSITA are included in _ESASky_: [eFEDS main](#eFEDSmain), [eFEDS hard](#eFEDShard), [etaCha main](#etaChamain), [etaCha hard](#etaChahard).

### eFEDS main catalogue

*   Release: EDR (2021)

*   Date of observations: 3-7 November 2019

*   Source: [eROSITA EDR catalogues](https://erosita.mpe.mpg.de/edr/eROSITAObservations/Catalogues/)

The eROSITA X-ray telescope on board the Spectrum-Poentgen-Gamma (SPG) observatory combines a large field of view and a large collecting area in the energy range between ~0.2 and ~8.0 keV. This gives the telescope the capability to perform uniform scanning observations of large sky areas. SRG/eROSITA performed scanning observations of the ~140 square degree eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth Survey field (the eFEDS field) as part of its performance verification phase ahead of the planned four year of all-sky scanning operations. The observing time of eFEDS was chosen to slightly exceed the depth expected in an equatorial field after the completion of the all\-sky survey. While verifying the capability of eROSITA to perform large-area uniform surveys and saving as a test and training dataset to establish calibration and data analysis procedures, the eFEDS survey also constitutes the largest contiguous soft X-ray survey at this depth to date, supporting a range of early eROSITA survey science investigations. 

The eFEDS main catalogue contains X-ray sources detected in the 0.2-2.3 keV band using eSASS adopting a detection likelihood threshold of 5. The sources with detection likelihood larger than 6 are selected as the main eFEDS catalog (27910 sources).

The eta Cha main catalogue is a catalogue of X-ray sources in the eta Chamaeleontis field scan observation (OBSID 300004). The nearby young open cluster eta Chamaeleontis was observed by eROSITA/SRG during its CalPV phase for 150 ks. The eROSITA data were taken in the field-scan mode, an observing mode of Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) that follows a rectangular grid-like pattern, here covering a 5x5 deg field with an exposure depth of about 5 ks. The known members were studied in X-rays and potential new members of the anticipated dispersed low-mass cluster population were searched for.

### GLADE+ Galaxy Catalog

*   Release: GLADE+ (2022)

*   Date of observations: from  ###24 October 2011 to 27 May 2020

*   Source: [GLADE+](https://glade.elte.hu/index.html)

*   Reference: [Dálya et. al. (2022) MNRAS, 514, 1403](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.514.1403D/abstract)

GLADE+ is an extended version of the GLADE galaxy catalog for multimessenger searches with advanced gravitational-wave detectors. GLADE+ combines data from six separate but not independent astronomical catalogues: the GWGC, 2MPZ, 2MASS XSC, HyperLEDA, and WISExSCOSPZ galaxy catalogues, and the SDSS-DR16Q quasar catalogue. GLADE+ contains ~22.5 million galaxies and ~750,000 quasars. GLADE+ is complete up to a luminosity distance of ~44 Mpc in terms of the cumulative B-band luminosity of galaxies, and contains all of the brightest galaxies giving half of the total B-band luminosity up to ~95 Mpc. Considering the brightest galaxies giving half of the total luminosity in the W1-band, GLADE+ has nearly 90% completeness at even ~500 Mpc. Stellar masses and binary neutron star mergers for galaxies with W1 magnitudes have been derived. These parameters can help to rank the galaxies in a given gravitational wave localization volume, thereby possibly reducing the number of pointings and the total integration time needed to find the electromagnetic counterpart. The codes used for the stellar mass and and merger rate calculations can be found on [Github](https://github.com/MariaPalfi/Stellar_masses_for_GLADE). For more information see [Dálya et. al.

### IceCube All-Sky Point-Source Events Catalog (2008 - 2018)

*   Release: 1.0 (2021)

*   Date of observations: from 2008 to 2018

*   Source: [IceCube Neutrino Observatory](https://icecube.wisc.edu/)

*   Reference: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09836](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09836) and [IceCube collaboration 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PhRvL.124e1103A/abstract)

IceCube has performed several searches for point-like sources of neutrinos. The events contained in the IceCube All-Sky Point-Source Events Catalog (2008 - 2018; Icecubepsc) make up the sample used in IceCube's 10-year time-integrated neutrino point source search. Events in the sample are track-like neutrino candidates detected by IceCube between April 2008 and July 2018.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** ESASky displays fewer events than those available in the [IceCube All-Sky Point-Source Events Catalog](http://doi.org/DOI:10.21234/sxvs-mt83) in order to show a less crowded display. An energy cut has been applied to the data to remove most of the lower energy events, therefore, ESASky display events with energies of E>104 GeV in the Northern hemisphere and events with energies of E>105.8 GeV in the Southern hemisphere (approximately the top 1% events in energy; 26706 neutrino candidate events). See the below figure from the Icecube Collaboration (2021) publication ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09836](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09836)) showing the distribution of events as a function of reconstructed declination and event energy:

### LAMOST GENERAL CATALOGS (LAMOST DR8)

*   Release: 8.0 (2022)

*   Date of observations: from 24 October 2011 to 27 May 2020

The Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) is a Chinese national scientific research facility operated by the National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences. It is a special reflecting Schmidt telescope with 4000 fibers in a field of view of 20 degrees. The LAMOST survey provides flux - and wavelength-calibrated, sky-subtracted spectra in the wavelength range of 3700-9000 angstrom for many types of astronomical objects. Since October 2018, LAMOST started the second stage survey program containing both low- and medium-resolution spectroscopic surveys, and the medium-resolution spectroscopic survey includes two surveys, i.e., the time-domain and the non time-domain surveys.

The eighth LAMOST data release (LAMOST DR8) includes observations until June 2020. The Low-Resolution spectroscopic survey (LRS) General Catalog contains 10,633,515 spectra, of which 10,336,752 are stars, 224,702 are galaxies, 72,061 are QSOs, and there are 9,563,115 spectra with g-band SNR or i-band SNR larger than 10. The Medium-Resolution spectroscopic survey (MRS) General Catalog contains 5,975,982 spectra, where there are 1,465,789 and 4,510,193 spectra for the non time-domain and time-domain surveys, respectively. (Note: This catalog contains in total 22,141,635 entries, which is different from the two statistics numbers above. For the number of the non-time-domain survey, we only count each of the coadded spectra as one of the 1,465,789 spectra, while for the time-domain survey, every single exposure of the B band plus R band were regarded as one of the 4,510,193 spectra.)

The following columns have been included in _ESASky_:

The Two-Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) covered 99.998% of the sky in three near-infrared bands, J, H and Ks. The 2MASS Point Source Catalog (PSC) contains positional and photometric information for 470,992,970 point sources. Sources in this catalogue are detected in at least one band with S/N higher than 7, or in all three bands with S/N higher than 5. In addition, the source position must fulfil some conditions to ensure it is not a spurious detection or there is confusion between sources.

### Legacy archive (HIPPARCOS):

The Hipparcos Catalogue (118,218 stars with 1 milliarcsec level astrometry) and the Tycho Catalogue (more than one million stars with 20-30 milliarcsec astrometry and two-colour photometry) were completed in August 1996 and its data products were released in June 1997. Further improved catalogues were made available to the science community later. This Galaxy charter mission has produced four major catalogues referred to as the Hipparcos-1 Catalogue, the Tycho-1 Catalogue, the Hipparcos-2 Catalogue, and the Tycho-2 Catalogue.

These are the 42 Hipparcos data products (catalogues and annexes) currently available via the [ESASky legacy TAP query](http://esaskylegacy.esac.esa.int/esasky-legacy-sl-tap/tap) as a self-standing catalogue collection, providing a single unified method of accessing all Hipparcos/Tycho data products and their successors.​​​​​​ You can access them using the [Topcat](http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat/) tool, selecting the option "Table Access Protocol (TAP) Query" in the VO menu, and introducing the TAP url in the "Select Service" pane.

The summary of the 42 data products (or 59 tables) is shown in Table 1. Hipparcos-1 data products are complete except for identification charts and light-curve figures which can be found in the file Hip1-CDROMs-Volume17.zip in the HIPPARCOS\_PUBLIC\_DATA area on the ftp.cosmos.esa.int ftp server. Tycho-1 has been completed with the Epoch Photometry Annex B, and Hipparcos-2 and Tycho-2 with Intermediate Astrometry data products. The latter is considered an extension, as these data had never been published before. The Tycho Slit Response Functions (SRFs) that have been used in the Tycho-2 data processing can be found [here](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/documents/401090/401110/tycSRF.txt/c7a3383d-462a-eb5f-2420-f4195cf2d021?t=1639135291743) and are described [here](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/documents/401090/6118054/Tycho_SRF_ReadMe.txt/4ed9522d-e931-f39b-91ce-79902c1933ac?t=1639135332767).

**Source:**

Most tables have been obtained from the CDS/VizieR TAP service, where column labels and descriptions underwent curation by CDS/VizieR. The tables in boldface were downloaded from the VizieR ftp instead of TAP service. The data models for hipparcos1 tables #3-#6 were also obtained from the VizieR ftp (so they include CDS metadata curation), including as metadata descriptions both explanations and corresponding notes. For 14 tables, we constructed the corresponding data model from the original documentation, using the original Hipparcos column label naming convention and including as metadata descriptions the original Hipparcos explanations. 

Since the Tycho-1 Epoch Photometry - Annex B data hosted at CDS/Vizier was severely corrupted, two tables in data product #32 marked with an asterisk) were recovered from original CD-ROMs kindly provided by Claus Fabricius, member of the Tycho consortium. Although still presenting a [partial loss of the original data](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/documents/401090/6118054/tyc_epo_ReadMe_28_June_2021.txt/7764a663-366a-5b90-ade9-edadef61530d?t=1624885489525), fewer data records are affected by corruption. 

Data products #19, #21, #22, #23, #29, #30, #31 and #36 were tables originally stacked together in rows mixing header and data records. For the sake of database ingestion, these data products have been split in their basic table structures, and the legacy\_astro TAP serves them individually. Unique keys allow connecting the records back together.

Hipparcos-2 data products #25-#29 are served in two versions: a CDS/VizieR version (namespace hipparcos2\_cds) and a Springer book DVD version (namespace hipparcos2\_dvd). Hipparcos-2 intermediate astrometry is only available on the DVD and it is important that these intermediate data are only used together with the astrometric reference parameters coming from the main tables from the same DVD. The raw contents of the DVD can be found in the file Hip2-DVD-Book.zip in the HIPPARCOS\_PUBLIC\_DATA area on the ftp.cosmos.esa.int ftp server.

**Metadata:**

*   Sky coordinates RAdeg, DEdeg are provided in ICRS system in units of degrees, with epoch J1991.25 (average observing time for the Hipparcos mission), except for the Tycho-2 Intermediate Astrometry (J1992.0) and the Double Star Catalogue and Supplement and the Two-colour Photometry for Components of Hipparcos Doubles Catalogue, at observation epoch J2000.0.
    
*   Currently, our Legacy Archive TAP server does not preserve the data precision for trailing zeroes. To retrieve the table precision information, please refer to the original table data model section and table number in [Hipparcos Vol 1: Introduction and Guide to the Data](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/documents/532822/552851/vol1_all.pdf/99adf6e3-6893-4824-8fc2-8d3c9cbba2b5), provided in column #8
    
*   Question marks in the table descriptions are equivalent to dagger in the table data model shown in the documentation, meaning blank for undefined values.
    
*   Asterisk at the beginning of the column description and numbers in brackets at the end of descriptions refer to Notes in the [Hipparcos Vol 1: Introduction and Guide to the Data](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/documents/532822/552851/vol1_all.pdf/99adf6e3-6893-4824-8fc2-8d3c9cbba2b5)
    
*   The original hipparcos1.hipoint and hipparcos1.hipjtran records have several occurrences of type overflow that have been replaced by "null" values.
    
*   For 6 Tycho tables, a Tycho identifier (ID) was created as an aggregate of the TYC numbers. It is constructed from the GSC region number (TYC1)\[1,9537\], the running number within the region (TYC2)\[1,12119\], and a component identifier (TYC3)\[1,4\], separated by a hyphen between them, e.g. TYC 1-13-1.

### Legacy archive (Cos-B): 

ESA's satellite [Cos-B](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Cos-B_overview2) carried a single large experiment, the Gamma-Ray Telescope, which was the responsibility of a group of European research laboratories know as the Caravane Collaboration. Launched on the 9 August 1975, Cos-B was originally projected to last two years, but it operated successfully for 6 years and 8 months. It provided the first complete map of the Galaxy in gamma-rays, and a catalogue of gamma-ray sources, known as the 2CG catalogue.

The Cos-B payload was conformed by two elements: 

*   Magnetic-core, wire-matrix, spark chamber gamma-ray detector (~30 MeV-5 GeV), eff. area 50 cm2 at 400 MeV
    
*   a 2-12 keV proportional scintillation counter mounted on the side of the gamma-ray detector
    
The main scientific results produced by Cos-B were

*   Extragalactic Gamma Rays
    
*   Resolved Galactic Sources
    
*   Gamma-Ray Pulsars
    
*   Binary Systems
    
*   Large Scale Galactic Emission
    
*   Localised Gamma-Ray Sources

The satellite was operated in a pointing mode with its spin axis directed towards fixed points in the sky for periods of four to five weeks early in the mission and up to 3 months in later observations. In total 64 observations (or pointings) were made. A broad band along the galactic equator was studied deeply, by means of repeated or overlapped observations. About 50% of the celestial sphere was covered and about one quarter of the time was devoted to observations at higher galactic latitudes, especially regions expected to contain extragalactic sources. The experiment operated for about 25 hours in each 37-hour orbit.

Comparison of data from overlapping observation periods enabled the long-term sensitivity changes of Cos-B to be estimated. Until three years into the mission, the sensitivity was virtually stable, but a slow fall-off developed. From this monitoring, curves such as the empirical correction factors have been derived. However the level of the background component improved with time. This background was due largely to interactions of cosmic rays with the massive parts of the experiment and surrounding spacecraft subsystems. This was reduced significantly by the increasing modulation of the cosmic rays with the approach of the solar maximum. This effect served to counter-balance the reduction in detector sensitivity.

**Catalogues and Data Products:**

Hitherto, the High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive at HEASARC was the only facility hosting the Cos-B data products in its [Observatories (Past missions) archive](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/cosb/cosb.html). It served raw data (.evt), image (.gif) and exposure maps (.fits) from the gamma-ray detector, and the analysis package FADMAP, alongside with the calibration data. These data have been repatriated to the ESA Legacy Archive in 2021 and are accessible via the [ESASky legacy TAP query](http://esaskylegacy.esac.esa.int/esasky-legacy-sl-tap/tap).

The ESA Legacy Archive includes two tables produced by the Cos-B mission. The provenance of these tables is the [HEASARC TAP](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/xamin/vo/tap).

The COSBMAP table is a log of the 63 x 6 available high level product files per energy range, rendering a total of 1,512 files available. The COSBRAW  table is a log of the 65 Cos-B observation intervals and contains target names, sky coordinates start times and other information taken from the final Cos-B database produced by ESA in 1985.

**High level Products****:** The Cos-B data products consist of maps obtained from the 65 Cos-B observations made during the entire mission. There are 4 sets of maps per observation, extracted over different energy ranges. These energy ranges are:

*   "low" (70-150 MeV),
*   "medium" (150-300 MeV),
*   "high" (300-5000 MeV),
*   and "full" (50-7800 MeV).

Each set includes three maps: a "counts" map, an "exposure" map, and a "flux" map. The "flux" map was obtained by dividing the "counts" map for the "exposure" maps. Each observation, therefore, has 12 associated maps. These maps are provided via DataLink in FITS and GIF format.

The Cos-B data products were created using the program [fadmap](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/FTP/software/ftools/release/help/fadmap.txt). Each of the FITS maps are 120 x 120 pixels with 0.5 degrees per pixel. Header keywords record the parameter values used in fadmap (see below) to create the maps. The FITS images may be displayed using any standard package which accepts FITS images.

The file\_image column corresponds to the name of the events file in the archive associated with each observation. Files are of the form cb\_hhmmVddP\*\*t\_b.xxx, where cb is the instrument (Cos-B), hhmm is the right ascension in degrees and minutes, V is N for positive declinations and S is for negative declination, dd is the declination in degrees, P is for 'Pointed' observations '\*\*' is the original observation number, from 00 to 64, t is the datafile 'type' (b for 'background', s for 'source'), b is the 'band' (l for 'low', m for 'medium', h for 'high', and t for 'total') and xxx is the FITS file 'type' (img for 'image', exp for 'exposure', flux for 'modified flux map' or gif for 'graphical image format'). There will be one GIF image for the source image, exposure map and flux map. These GIFs will have the form cb\_hhmmVddP\*\*t\_b\_X.gif, where all the values are the same as for the ordinary FITS maps, but the value 'X' will distinguish which file is represented in the GIF. 'X' will be 'i' (for image), 'e' (for exposure) and 'f' (for flux). An example filename would be cb\_1721s44p24s\_l\_i.gif. This file is a Cos-B point centered on RA=17h21m, DEC=-44, the original Cos-B point number 24, source image file in the 'low' energy band, in GIF format.

The \* .img \*.exp and \*.flux maps associated to the cb\_0109s74p15.evt and cb\_1841n80p35.evt events were not generated because the original code only allows to build maps with declination between -65 deg to 65 deg. These two files are at -74 and +80, respectively.

Raw data: The final reduction of the Cos\-B data, released by ESA in 1985, consisted of three basic datasets: \`OBSLI\`, describing each observation period (typically one month), \`OURLI\`, describing each uninterrupted observation interval (lasting between 10 minutes and 10 hours), and \`GAMLI\`, containing records for each accepted gamma-ray photon. These three data sets were combined into FITS format with an event layout at the HEASARC.

Each event file contains three extensions: good time interval (EXTNAME = 'ALLGTI'), event (EXTNAME = 'EVENTS'), and housekeeping (EXTNAME = 'TSI'). The ALLGTI and TSI extensions contain the information stored in the \`OURLI\` and \`OBSLI\` datasets. The EVENTS extension contains data from the \`GAMLI\` dataset. There are, in total, 65 files, one for each \`OBSLI\` observation. Photon positions (RA and DEC) were converted to pixels within a 512 X 512 pixel pseudo-image array. Each pixel is 0.1 degrees so the image is 51.2 X 51.2 degrees.

The program [fadmap](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/FTP/software/ftools/release/help/fadmap.txt) can be used on the raw data files to generate maps with different parameter setups or different time selections from those used for the high level products.

The COSBRAW  database consisted of three basic datasets: \`OBSLI\`, a dataset describing each observation period, typically a month; \`OURLI\`, a dataset describing each uninterrupted observation interval, lasting between 10 minutes and 10 hours; and \`GAMLI\`, a dataset containing records for each accepted gamma-ray photon. These three data sets were combined into FITS format images at NASA/GSFC. The images were formed by making the center pixel of a 1024 x 1024 pixel image correspond to the RA and DEC given in the \`OBSLI\` file. Each photon's RA and DEC was converted to a relative pixel in the image. This was done by using Aitoff projections. All the raw data from these three Cos-B files are now stored in 65 FITS files accessible via DataLink.

The Cos-B event files naming convention is cb\_hhmmVddP\*\*.evt where  hhmm is the right ascension in degrees and minutes, V is N for positive declinations and S is for negative declination, dd is the declination in degrees, P is for 'Pointed' observations '\*\*' is the original observation number, from 00 to 64. (e.g CB2251S18P41.evt was the 42nd observation, and the source coordinates are RA 2251 DEC -18).

# ESASky Legacy TAP: ESA Legacy Missions - ESDC - Cosmos

ESASky legacy is a TAP ([Table Access Protocol](http://www.ivoa.net/documents/TAP/)) service to provide the community access to complete, self-standing catalogues and data collections from ESA astronomy legacy missions, ensuring their long-term preservation. This service, which is an [IVOA](http://www.ivoa.net/) standard for most modern science archives, is an entry point to data products and their successors that can be exposed by ESASky.

The ESA Legacy Missions available in the [ESASky legacy TAP](http://esaskylegacy.esac.esa.int/esasky-legacy-sl-tap/tap) are:

*   [Hipparcos](#Legacy:Hipparcos)

*   [Cos-B](#Legacy:CosB)

*   [CoRoT](#Legacy:CoRoT)

### Legacy archive (HIPPARCOS):

The Hipparcos Catalogue (118,218 stars with 1 milliarcsec level astrometry) and the Tycho Catalogue (more than one million stars with 20-30 milliarcsec astrometry and two-colour photometry) were completed in August 1996 and its data products were released in June 1997. Further improved catalogues were made available to the science community later. This Galaxy charter mission has produced four major catalogues referred to as the Hipparcos-1 Catalogue, the Tycho-1 Catalogue, the Hipparcos-2 Catalogue, and the Tycho-2 Catalogue.

These are the 42 Hipparcos data products (catalogues and annexes) currently available via the [ESASky legacy TAP query](http://esaskylegacy.esac.esa.int/esasky-legacy-sl-tap/tap) as a self-standing catalogue collection, providing a single unified method of accessing all Hipparcos/Tycho data products and their successors.​​​​​​ You can access them using the [Topcat](http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat/) tool, selecting the option "Table Access Protocol (TAP) Query" in the VO menu, and introducing the TAP url in the "Select Service" pane.

The summary of the 42 data products (or 59 tables) is shown in Table 1. Hipparcos-1 data products are complete except for identification charts and light-curve figures which can be found in the file Hip1-CDROMs-Volume17.zip in the HIPPARCOS\_PUBLIC\_DATA area on the ftp.cosmos.esa.int ftp server. Tycho-1 has been completed with the Epoch Photometry Annex B, and Hipparcos-2 and Tycho-2 with Intermediate Astrometry data products. The latter is considered an extension, as these data had never been published before. The Tycho Slit Response Functions (SRFs) that have been used in the Tycho-2 data processing can be found [here](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/documents/401090/401110/tycSRF.txt/c7a3383d-462a-eb5f-2420-f4195cf2d021?t=1639135291743) and are described [here](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/documents/401090/6118054/Tycho_SRF_ReadMe.txt/4ed9522d-e931-f39b-91ce-79902c1933ac?t=1639135332767).

**Source:**

Most tables have been obtained from the CDS/VizieR TAP service, where column labels and descriptions underwent curation by CDS/VizieR. The tables in boldface were downloaded from the VizieR ftp instead of TAP service. The data models for hipparcos1 tables #3-#6 were also obtained from the VizieR ftp (so they include CDS metadata curation), including as metadata descriptions both explanations and corresponding notes. For 14 tables, we constructed the corresponding data model from the original documentation, using the original Hipparcos column label naming convention and including as metadata descriptions the original Hipparcos explanations. 

Since the Tycho-1 Epoch Photometry - Annex B data hosted at CDS/Vizier was severely corrupted, two tables in data product #32 marked with an asterisk) were recovered from original CD-ROMs kindly provided by Claus Fabricius, member of the Tycho consortium. Although still presenting a [partial loss of the original data](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/documents/401090/6118054/tyc_epo_ReadMe_28_June_2021.txt/7764a663-366a-5b90-ade9-edadef61530d?t=1624885489525), fewer data records are affected by corruption. 

Data products #19, #21, #22, #23, #29, #30, #31 and #36 were tables originally stacked together in rows mixing header and data records. For the sake of database ingestion, these data products have been split in their basic table structures, and the legacy\_astro TAP serves them individually. Unique keys allow connecting the records back together.

Hipparcos-2 data products #25-#29 are served in two versions: a CDS/VizieR version (namespace hipparcos2\_cds) and a Springer book DVD version (namespace hipparcos2\_dvd). Hipparcos-2 intermediate astrometry is only available on the DVD and it is important that these intermediate data are only used together with the astrometric reference parameters coming from the main tables from the same DVD. The raw contents of the DVD can be found in the file Hip2-DVD-Book.zip in the HIPPARCOS\_PUBLIC\_DATA area on the ftp.cosmos.esa.int ftp server.

**Metadata:**

*   Sky coordinates RAdeg, DEdeg are provided in ICRS system in units of degrees, with epoch J1991.25 (average observing time for the Hipparcos mission), except for the Tycho-2 Intermediate Astrometry (J1992.0) and the Double Star Catalogue and Supplement and the Two-colour Photometry for Components of Hipparcos Doubles Catalogue, at observation epoch J2000.0.
    
*   Currently, our Legacy Archive TAP server does not preserve the data precision for trailing zeroes. To retrieve the table precision information, please refer to the original table data model section and table number in [Hipparcos Vol 1: Introduction and Guide to the Data](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/documents/532822/552851/vol1_all.pdf/99adf6e3-6893-4824-8fc2-8d3c9cbba2b5), provided in column #8
    
*   Question marks in the table descriptions are equivalent to dagger in the table data model shown in the documentation, meaning blank for undefined values.
    
*   Asterisk at the beginning of the column description and numbers in brackets at the end of descriptions refer to Notes in the [Hipparcos Vol 1: Introduction and Guide to the Data](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/documents/532822/552851/vol1_all.pdf/99adf6e3-6893-4824-8fc2-8d3c9cbba2b5)
    
*   The original hipparcos1.hipoint and hipparcos1.hipjtran records have several occurrences of type overflow that have been replaced by "null" values.
    
*   For 6 Tycho tables, a Tycho identifier (ID) was created as an aggregate of the TYC numbers. It is constructed from the GSC region number (TYC1)\[1,9537\], the running number within the region (TYC2)\[1,12119\], and a component identifier (TYC3)\[1,4\], separated by a hyphen between them, e.g. TYC 1-13-1.

### Legacy archive (Cos-B): 

ESA's satellite [Cos-B](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Cos-B_overview2) carried a single large experiment, the Gamma-Ray Telescope, which was the responsibility of a group of European research laboratories know as the Caravane Collaboration. Launched on the 9 August 1975, Cos-B was originally projected to last two years, but it operated successfully for 6 years and 8 months. It provided the first complete map of the Galaxy in gamma-rays, and a catalogue of gamma-ray sources, known as the 2CG catalogue.

The Cos-B payload was conformed by two elements: 

*   Magnetic-core, wire-matrix, spark chamber gamma-ray detector (~30 MeV-5 GeV), eff. area 50 cm2 at 400 MeV
    
*   a 2-12 keV proportional scintillation counter mounted on the side of the gamma-ray detector
    
The main scientific results produced by Cos-B were

*   Extragalactic Gamma Rays
    
*   Resolved Galactic Sources
    
*   Gamma-Ray Pulsars
    
*   Binary Systems
    
*   Large Scale Galactic Emission
    
*   Localised Gamma-Ray Sources
    
**Operations and Performance:**

The satellite was operated in a pointing mode with its spin axis directed towards fixed points in the sky for periods of four to five weeks early in the mission and up to 3 months in later observations. In total 64 observations (or pointings) were made. A broad band along the galactic equator was studied deeply, by means of repeated or overlapped observations. About 50% of the celestial sphere was covered and about one quarter of the time was devoted to observations at higher galactic latitudes, especially regions expected to contain extragalactic sources. The experiment operated for about 25 hours in each 37-hour orbit.

Comparison of data from overlapping observation periods enabled the long-term sensitivity changes of Cos-B to be estimated. Until three years into the mission, the sensitivity was virtually stable, but a slow fall-off developed. From this monitoring, curves such as the empirical correction factors have been derived. However the level of the background component improved with time. This background was due largely to interactions of cosmic rays with the massive parts of the experiment and surrounding spacecraft subsystems. This was reduced significantly by the increasing modulation of the cosmic rays with the approach of the solar maximum. This effect served to counter-balance the reduction in detector sensitivity.

**Catalogues and Data Products:**

Hitherto, the High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive at HEASARC was the only facility hosting the Cos-B data products in its [Observatories (Past missions) archive](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/cosb/cosb.html). It served raw data (.evt), image (.gif) and exposure maps (.fits) from the gamma-ray detector, and the analysis package FADMAP, alongside with the calibration data. These data have been repatriated to the ESA Legacy Archive in 2021 and are accessible via the [ESASky legacy TAP query](http://esaskylegacy.esac.esa.int/esasky-legacy-sl-tap/tap).

The ESA Legacy Archive includes two tables produced by the Cos-B mission. The provenance of these tables is the [HEASARC TAP](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/xamin/vo/tap).

The COSBMAP table is a log of the 63 x 6 available high level product files per energy range, rendering a total of 1,512 files available. The COSBRAW  table is a log of the 65 Cos-B observation intervals and contains target names, sky coordinates start times and other information taken from the final Cos-B database produced by ESA in 1985.

**High level Products****:** The Cos-B data products consist of maps obtained from the 65 Cos-B observations made during the entire mission. There are 4 sets of maps per observation, extracted over different energy ranges. These energy ranges are:

*   "low" (70-150 MeV),
*   "medium" (150-300 MeV),
*   "high" (300-5000 MeV),
*   and "full" (50-7800 MeV).

Each set includes three maps: a "counts" map, an "exposure" map, and a "flux" map. The "flux" map was obtained by dividing the "counts" map for the "exposure" maps. Each observation, therefore, has 12 associated maps. These maps are provided via DataLink in FITS and GIF format.

The Cos-B data products were created using the program [fadmap](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/FTP/software/ftools/release/help/fadmap.txt). Each of the FITS maps are 120 x 120 pixels with 0.5 degrees per pixel. Header keywords record the parameter values used in fadmap (see below) to create the maps. The FITS images may be displayed using any standard package which accepts FITS images.

The file\_image column corresponds to the name of the events file in the archive associated with each observation. Files are of the form cb\_hhmmVddP\*\*t\_b.xxx, where cb is the instrument (Cos-B), hhmm is the right ascension in degrees and minutes, V is N for positive declinations and S is for negative declination, dd is the declination in degrees, P is for 'Pointed' observations '\*\*' is the original observation number, from 00 to 64, t is the datafile 'type' (b for 'background', s for 'source'), b is the 'band' (l for 'low', m for 'medium', h for 'high', and t for 'total') and xxx is the FITS file 'type' (img for 'image', exp for 'exposure', flux for 'modified flux map' or gif for 'graphical image format'). There will be one GIF image for the source image, exposure map and flux map. These GIFs will have the form cb\_hhmmVddP\*\*t\_b\_X.gif, where all the values are the same as for the ordinary FITS maps, but the value 'X' will distinguish which file is represented in the GIF. 'X' will be 'i' (for image), 'e' (for exposure) and 'f' (for flux). An example filename would be cb\_1721s44p24s\_l\_i.gif. This file is a Cos-B point centered on RA=17h21m, DEC=-44, the original Cos-B point number 24, source image file in the 'low' energy band, in GIF format.

The \* .img \*.exp and \*.flux maps associated to the cb\_0109s74p15.evt and cb\_1841n80p35.evt events were not generated because the original code only allows to build maps with declination between -65 deg to 65 deg. These two files are at -74 and +80, respectively.

Raw data: The final reduction of the Cos\-B data, released by ESA in 1985, consisted of three basic datasets: \`OBSLI\`, describing each observation period (typically one month), \`OURLI\`, describing each uninterrupted observation interval (lasting between 10 minutes and 10 hours), and \`GAMLI\`, containing records for each accepted gamma-ray photon. These three data sets were combined into FITS format with an event layout at the HEASARC.

Each event file contains three extensions: good time interval (EXTNAME = 'ALLGTI'), event (EXTNAME = 'EVENTS'), and housekeeping (EXTNAME = 'TSI'). The ALLGTI and TSI extensions contain the information stored in the \`OURLI\` and \`OBSLI\` datasets. The EVENTS extension contains data from the \`GAMLI\` dataset. There are, in total, 65 files, one for each \`OBSLI\` observation. Photon positions (RA and DEC) were converted to pixels within a 512 X 512 pixel pseudo-image array. Each pixel is 0.1 degrees so the image is 51.2 X 51.2 degrees.

The program [fadmap](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/FTP/software/ftools/release/help/fadmap.txt) can be used on the raw data files to generate maps with different parameter setups or different time selections from those used for the high level products.

The COSBRAW  database consisted of three basic datasets: \`OBSLI\`, a dataset describing each observation period, typically a month; \`OURLI\`, a dataset describing each uninterrupted observation interval, lasting between 10 minutes and 10 hours; and \`GAMLI\`, a dataset containing records for each accepted gamma-ray photon. These three data sets were combined into FITS format images at NASA/GSFC. The images were formed by making the center pixel of a 1024 x 1024 pixel image correspond to the RA and DEC given in the \`OBSLI\` file. Each photon's RA and DEC was converted to a relative pixel in the image. This was done by using Aitoff projections. All the raw data from these three Cos-B files are now stored in 65 FITS files accessible via DataLink.

The Cos-B event files naming convention is cb\_hhmmVddP\*\*.evt where  hhmm is the right ascension in degrees and minutes, V is N for positive declinations and S is for negative declination, dd is the declination in degrees, P is for 'Pointed' observations '\*\*' is the original observation number, from 00 to 64. (e.g CB2251S18P41.evt was the 42nd observation, and the source coordinates are RA 2251 DEC -18).

### Legacy archive (CoRoT): 

[CoRoT](https://sci.esa.int/web/corot/)(Convection, Rotation and planetary Transits) is the first space mission dedicated to exoplanetary research and designed for this purpose. The spacecraft was equipped with a 27 cm-diameter afocal telescope and a 4-CCD wide-field camera, was built around the PROTEUS spacecraft bus, and operated in a low-Earth orbit (LEO) of ~900 km (polar). Launched in December 2006 the mission had a nominal lifetime of 2.5 years. The scientific mission was officially ended the 20th of June 2013 and the satellite was de-orbited on 17 June 2014. During its observation phase, CoRoT continuously observed star fields in the Milky Way for periods of up to 6 months, recording the photometric light curve of about 150 distinct bright stars (with a visible magnitude between 5.8 and 8) using the bright stars channel (also known as the seismology channel) and more than 160 000 faint stars (with a visible magnitude between 10.5 and 16) using the faint stars channel (also known as the exoplanet channel. The project was led by CNES, with contributions from ESA, Austria, Belgium, Germany, Spain and Brazil.

From a polar inertial circular orbit (90-degree inclination) at an altitude of 896 km, the CoRoT programme of observations was based on a yearly cycle of 4 runs. During the summer period from October to March, the telescope was pointed towards the anticentre of the Milky Way and during the winter period from April to September, in the opposite direction. Two observation runs (alternately 20 and 150 days) were achieved during each summer and winter period in general. Twice a year, when the Sun got closer to the orbit plane and was about to blind the telescope, the spacecraft performed a reversal attitude manoeuvre.

Some of the features of the 26 CoRoT fields are extracted from [2018A&A...619A..97D](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2018/11/aa31068-17/aa31068-17.html)

[CoRoT](https://corot.cnes.fr/en/COROT/index.htm) produced nearly 6 years of data that are accessible online. The ["CoRoT Legacy Book"](https://www.edp-open.org/books/edp-open-books/320-the-corot-legacy-book) describes these [data](http://idoc-corot.ias.u-psud.fr/sitools/common/html/doc/cII_4_data.pdf) and their correction methods, the most recent highlights up to now, and the new space projects that inherit from CoRoT. The different scientific products levels were made available in various [science archives](https://www.edp-open.org/images/stories/books/contents/corot/cII_5.pdf).

The ESA Legacy TAP includes the last version (N2-4.4) of the Bright and Faint star catalogues produced by CoRoT. The provenance of these tables is the CDS/Vizier TAP.
